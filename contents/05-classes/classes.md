# Classes

Classes really are the bread and butter of object oriented programming (OOP). They are the building blocks of any applications which allow you to create *"objects"* to work with.

Essentially, a class couples together variables/contants and functions into one manageable package for you to work with.

Classes are abstract blueprints for the objects that your application needs to work with.

```Swift
class Person {

}
```
